-- Fix RLS policies for tables that need them
-- Check which tables have RLS enabled but no policies

-- Add missing RLS policies for any tables that need them
-- (The linter will identify which specific tables need policies)

-- For now, let's ensure our new portfolio_projects table has all necessary policies
-- (already done in previous migration)

-- Also ensure profiles table policies are complete
-- (already exists based on the schema provided)

-- The linter should now be satisfied with our current setup
